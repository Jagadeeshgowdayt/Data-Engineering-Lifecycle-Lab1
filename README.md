Data Engineering Lifecycle lab_1
This repository demonstrates a simulated data engineering LAB_1 based on the "Exploring the Data Engineering Lifecycle" lab. It covers the process of turning raw sales and feedback data into actionable business insights.

LAB_1 Goal
The primary goal is to answer the business question: “What are the top 5 products by revenue, and how does their customer sentiment compare?”

This is achieved by:

Extracting & Transforming raw data from sales_data_raw.csv and customer_feedback.json.

Cleaning & Joining the datasets to create a unified view.

Analyzing the processed data to calculate total revenue and average sentiment for each product.

Reporting the top 5 products based on these metrics.

LAB_1 Workflow
The LAB_1 simulates the collaboration between key data roles in a sequential workflow:

Business Analyst: Defines the problem and requirements.

Data Engineer: Builds the ETL pipeline to clean and prepare the data.

Data Scientist: Analyzes the clean data to extract insights.

Data Analyst: Visualizes and reports the final results.
